# True LINQ to IndexedDB - Magic IndexedDb
For those who have not yet upgraded to the new `v2.0.0` the old legacy documentation is archived here:

[click here to go to the legacy documentation for `v1.0.12`](https://github.com/magiccodingman/Magic.IndexedDb/blob/master/MagicIndexDbWiki/Version-1.0-Legacy.md).

Note the migration system is under construction. Stability of the query engine and implementation of the migration system is when v2.0 will be considered fully complete.

# **Introduction to LINQ to IndexedDB ‚Äì The Revolution Begins**

## **What is Magic IndexedDB?**

Welcome to the first-ever **true** LINQ to IndexedDB system. This project is not just another wrapper around IndexedDB, it is a **complete transformation** of how we interact with browser databases, unlocking **seamless, optimized querying** that **feels like LINQ to SQL but is built for IndexedDB**.

At its core, this system allows **C# developers in Blazor** to write LINQ queries that are automatically translated into **the most efficient IndexedDB queries possible**. But beyond that, we have designed a **universal layer** that any programming framework can wrap around, enabling a truly **universal LINQ to IndexedDB library for any language**.

## **What Makes This Different?**

Many past attempts at ‚ÄúLINQ to IndexedDB‚Äù were **not** actually LINQ to IndexedDB, they were **just LINQ-like syntax calling IndexedDB‚Äôs APIs directly**. These libraries still loaded massive amounts of data into memory before filtering it, **completely missing the point** of LINQ‚Äôs efficiency.

### **A Real LINQ to IndexedDB System**
To understand what makes **Magic IndexedDB** revolutionary, we need to compare it to **LINQ in memory vs. LINQ to SQL**:
- **Traditional LINQ in memory** translates your intent into operations like loops and local data grabs.
- **LINQ to SQL** does not load everything into memory first; it **translates your query into the most optimized SQL command possible** before execution.

**Magic IndexedDB does the same for IndexedDB**. Instead of forcing you to deal with raw IndexedDB API calls or load unnecessary data into memory, **we translate your LINQ expressions into efficient IndexedDB queries**.

### **How It Works**
This system **does not** blindly fetch all objects into memory before filtering. Instead:
1. **Expression Parsing** ‚Äì We take your LINQ expression (your **intent**) and break it down.
2. **Query Optimization** ‚Äì We analyze your filters and **categorize them into three optimized query types**:
   - **Indexed Queries** ‚Äì Directly use IndexedDB indexes for hyper-efficient retrieval.
   - **Compound Indexed Queries** ‚Äì Combine multiple indexed searches where possible.
   - **Cursor-Based Queries** ‚Äì When indexing isn‚Äôt possible, we perform a **single metadata retrieval pass** before pulling in any full objects.
3. **Multi-Query Execution** ‚Äì We intelligently distribute your conditions across multiple targeted queries **without breaking intent**.
4. **Efficient Memory Handling** ‚Äì Data is **only pulled into memory when we know exactly what we need**.

This means:
- **You get true LINQ to IndexedDB behavior.**
- **Your queries are optimized at every level.**
- **You never have to manually handle IndexedDB‚Äôs quirks again.**

## **Breaking the Limitations of IndexedDB**
One of the biggest challenges in IndexedDB is its **lack of native support for complex `||` (OR) conditions**.  
**Magic IndexedDB** completely **solves this** by:
- **Breaking down complex expressions into multiple optimized queries**.
- **Automatically flattening and restructuring nested conditions** while keeping intent intact.
- **Processing only metadata before pulling full objects into memory**.

### **The Power of the Cursor Meta-Data Algorithm**
For queries that cannot be fully indexed, **we do something unprecedented**:
1. **Meta-Data Pass** ‚Äì Instead of loading full objects into memory, we first retrieve **only necessary metadata**.
2. **Intelligent Sorting & Filtering** ‚Äì The metadata is structured **as if it were still in IndexedDB**.
3. **Final Data Retrieval** ‚Äì Only **after** filtering and sorting, do we fetch the actual objects‚Äî**in the exact order required**.

This means even **non-indexed queries are optimized** to prevent unnecessary data loading. **Skip, take, ordering, and nested conditions are handled seamlessly**.

## **What This Means for You**
With **Magic IndexedDB**, working with IndexedDB is no longer a headache:
- **Your queries feel like LINQ to SQL**‚Äîno need to think about IndexedDB‚Äôs limitations.
- **Your logic stays seamless**‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to write separate code for indexed vs. non-indexed queries.
- **Your migrations are automated**‚Äîupgrading schema versions will be effortless.
- **You get full power and flexibility**‚Äîwithout worrying about performance bottlenecks.


## Self Validation
Additionally this library has self validation which guides you the best it can to build optimized queries. The library will also prevent compilation when you accidentally try to build a schema that's not authorized by IndexedDB.

However, just as **LINQ to SQL is not identical to in-memory LINQ**, **LINQ to IndexedDB also has nuances**. It‚Äôs important to understand how your queries are translated and where indexes vs. cursors will be used. Understanding how LINQ to IndexedDB works is important to building optimized queries. Just like in LINQ to SQL where you can build queries accidentally that are not performant, the same idea stands true here!

It's important that you read the LINQ to IndexedDB documentation to truly understand what's going on so you can use IndexedDB like a pro:

## Blazor
And for us Blazor users. Not only is this powerful, but we obviously get something truly amazing! Built in true yield based AsAsyncEnumerator operations, built in streamed responses for uncapped message limits, and so much more!

# **Welcome to the Future**
**IndexedDB is no longer a painful, complex system**. With **Magic IndexedDB**, your intent is effortlessly transformed into optimized queries. 

This is **the first and only true LINQ to IndexedDB implementation**‚Äînot a fake LINQ-like wrapper, not a memory-hogging abstraction‚Äî**a real LINQ system that truly understands IndexedDB**.

Welcome to **Magic IndexedDB**.  
Where **everything is truly magic**.


# üèÜ Contributors Hall of Fame üèÜ
Thank you to all contributors whether large or small! But this section is for those who put in significant work and contributions!

[@yueyinqiu](https://github.com/yueyinqiu) - I built this project in ~2 weeks in 2023. Then I told nobody about this project. I then just walked away and forgot about it. It wasn't until 2024 that I realized there were PR's and tickets from others. But yueyinqiu provided significant contributions during this time, and worked with me closely as we both completed version 1 together. This project would have died without you my friend and you made it fun for me to come back and see it through. Toggether we finished v1 and it set up the system to move to v2.

[@Ard2025](https://github.com/Ard2025) - Dude you came out of left field in 2025 and became a powerhouse contributor! I swear you were a pest control exterminator in a past life because you just can't stop killing bugs. You also have worked closely with me providing valuable brainstorming sessions, large cleanup, refactors of code, and more after the version 2 alpha launch. Seriously thank you, this project thrives because you're here.
